# AppleMusicRP - Apple Music Discord Rich Presence

**NOTE: Pre-Catalina macOS support should work but is not tested as I do not have access to an Intel Mac...**

A simple and light-weight menu bar application providing Discord Rich Presence support for Apple Music/iTunes on macOS and Windows!

## Highlights

- Light-weight (Uses only 0.5% CPU and less than 40MB of memory on 2020 M1 Macbook Air)
- Easy to install/use, all you need to do is run the app, no configuration required!
- Shows time elapsed (How far into the song you are)
- Status disappears after music is paused for >10 minutes and when no music is playing
- Universal Application (on macOS)
- Windows support

## Usage

### Windows

- Download the latest version (in Releases) and extract! 
- Run the application (`applemusicrp.exe`)
- That's it! You should now see a ðŸŽµ icon in your system tray :)!

### macOS

- Download the latest version (in Releases), double click it, and move the .app "file" to your Applications folder (or wherever you wish.)
- Run it (Make sure Discord is running; If you get an "Unidentified Developer" error, alt+click the application and then click Open.)
- That's it! You should now see a ðŸŽµ icon in your menu bar :)!

## Building

### Windows

**If you encounter issues, make sure to use Python from the official Python website and not from the Microsoft Store.**


`pip install wheel py2exe pypresence pyinstaller pywin32 psutil pystray pillow dialite`

`.\build.bat`

### macOS

**If you want to build a universal application, make sure you are using [Python 3.9.x universal2 from Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) and not the homebrew version.**

`brew install create-dmg`

`python3 -m pip install wheel py2app rumps pypresence dialite`

`chmod +x ./build.zsh; ./build.zsh`

## Planned Features

- ~~Time elapsed~~ **DONE!**

- ~~Support for pre-10.15 macOS (Should be a simple change of `tell application "Music"` to `tell application "iTunes")~~ **DONE!**

- ~~Windows support~~ **DONE!**

- Anything else that is suggested and reasonable :)
